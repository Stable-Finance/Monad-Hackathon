# Monad-Hackathon
The global financial system sits on vast untapped asset equity while increasingly relying on fiat issuance, fueling inflation and instability. Value should flow from assets, not to them.  

Stable proposes an asset-based financial system, using a medium of exchange backed by real-world value. Advances in AI and real-time monitoring enable increasingly precise asset valuation, making large-scale implementation more feasible each year. Real estate is the ideal starting pointâ€”globally traded, deeply embedded in finance, yet largely untapped in equity. Stable aims to dissolve that complexity, unlocking its true value.

During the Monad Hackathon, Stable brought pre-approved fixed-rate lending and lines of credit onchain along with asset-backed liquidity. The team coded multiple powerful, dynamic NFTs that appeal to the institutional and degenerate mind through the seamless transmutation of value from asset to liquidity. While the hackathon is over the team is just getting started. We achieved the deployment of USDX, the USD-pegged stablecoin backed by a basket of over-collateralized debt positions on real estate, and have begun a multithread incentivized campaign progressively unlocking features and integrations of 1) USDX, 2) the NFTs backing it, and 3) the Waifu Realty NFT colletion.

This repository serves as an aggregator of the resources and associated deployments that Matt and Winston built over the last 5 days.
